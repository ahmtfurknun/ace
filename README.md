# Ace 

There are a lot of people that follow and discuss sports almost in every corner of the world. People use platforms like Reddit and Twitter to discuss sports, and on these platforms, sports content takes up a lot of space. Therefore, we would like to build an app called “Ace” that will allow its user to share photos, videos, and post texts about any kind of sport. The application that we will take as an example in the technical aspect of our application will be Twitter. Firebase is used for the back-end of the application.
